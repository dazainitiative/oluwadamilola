                              <h3> High cost of getting Education or poor facility for learning.</h3>
                              <p>Education is seen as one of the major causes of Poverty.We live in a Country where education is an expensive asset.Children of the lower background can not afford to go to school because of the high levy placed on the school fees.
                                Talking of other schools that seem free,the facilities and equipments for knowledge are not in place.Consider the pupils in the picture who are sitting on tyres to learn. 
                                it is noted that the environment of learning is one of the determinants to good education of the learners.

                              <h3> Over-population due to lack of family planning.</h3>
                              <p>Nigeria is a country with a high population and limited resources.it could be an under statement to say limited resources instead of untapped or under-utized resources.We depend solely on few resources which can not sustain the number of citizens in the country.
                                However,there is a need to cob high birth rate which will lead to Over-population.These are some of the effects of Over-populationin our society.
